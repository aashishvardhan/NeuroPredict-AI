‚ú® Core Features
üß† Deep Learning Scan Analyzer: Upload a brain CT scan image to get an instant prediction of whether it shows signs of a brain hemorrhage. The analysis is powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with TensorFlow.

ü§ñ AI Health Assistant: An integrated chatbot, powered by the Chatbase API, provides users with instant answers to their health-related questions in a safe and conversational manner.

üèÉ Gamified Health Challenges: An interactive section where users can track their progress on healthy habits (e.g., a 7-day walking streak), encouraging long-term engagement.

‚ôø Accessibility Toolbar: The user interface includes controls to switch to a high-contrast mode and adjust the text size for improved readability and accessibility.

‚öïÔ∏è Health Information Hub: A multi-tabbed interface provides clear, concise information on:

Common Stroke Symptoms (F.A.S.T.)

Key Prevention Strategies

Stroke Classification (Ischemic vs. Hemorrhagic)

‚öñÔ∏è BMI Calculator: A built-in tool for users to calculate their Body Mass Index based on height, weight, and age.
